# Introduction
Ammonia is a common by-product of animal waste due to the inefficient conversion of feed nitrogen into animal manure (urine + feces). Livestock and poultry are often fed high-protein feed, which contains surplus nitrogen, to ensure that the animals' nutritional requirements are met. Nitrogen that is not metabolized into animal protein (i.e., milk, meat, or eggs) is excreted in the urine and feces of livestock and poultry where further microbial action (conversion of urinary urea to ammonia: the enzyme urease, released in feces, reacts with urinary urea to form NH3) releases ammonia into the air during manure decomposition.

As such, animal waste from livestock results in emissions of both NH3 (ammonia) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).  VOCs emitted by livestock can be defined as any compound of carbon (excluding carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, and ammonium carbonate) that may participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions and is emitted by livestock. Livestock is domesticated farm animals raised in an agricultural setting for home use or profit. The following livestock included in the NEI are expected to be the only ones that emit significant amounts of NH3: beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, poultry (layers, broilers, turkeys, ducks, geese), goats, horses, and sheep.

Traditional methods of developing emission inventories have relied on single emission factors which do not take into account meteorology or practices and how they differ across locations. Newer inventories may take into account empirical models that represent ammonia emissions as a function of a single variable, like temperature, in order to characterize some of the observed variability in emissions from different animal types (Figure 1). However, there are serious limitations to these methods as these empirical models are also often limited in their applicability in terms of conditions or locations for which their use is appropriate. An alternative to these purely empirical approaches is the process-based model.

Process-based models characterize variability in ammonia emissions by conducting a mass balance on the system, tracking a particular species, in this case ammoniacal nitrogen, throughout the entire system, breaking the production process into multiple stages to characterize all the emissions processes. This mass balance also describes emissions as a function of meteorological parameters and management practices.

In 2004, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) developed the FEM (Farm Emissions Model) to estimate NH3 emissions from dairy farm.  Over time, this model has been modified to include all major animal types such as swine, dairy cattle, beef cattle, poultry layers, and poultry broilers. We implemented the FEM that is a semi-empirical process-based emissions model, as they are based on a nitrogen mass balance with inputs of meteorological parameters and management practices to obtain the desired output of ammonia emissions as a function of time but will also be constrained through the use of tuned parameters to ensure agreement with previously reported ammonia emission factors. The semi-empirical process-based emission modeling approach allows us to evaluate the model for consistency with measured emission factors, maintain consistency by tracking the actual nitrogen available for emission (rather than as a function of an environmental variable), and estimate uncertainty in our modelâ€™s estimates of ammonia emissions, producing seasonally variable and daily variable

Initially, the version 2 of the 2014 National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, layers, and broilers were estimated using the FEM used. The processes include emissions from animal housing, waste storage, land application, and grazing. A combination of processes can vary by animal type. The FEM is a semi-empirical process-based emissions model designed for livestock waste emission sources based on nitrogen mass balances for each process, with losses controlled by mass transfer resistance parameters, which vary with meteorological conditions (Figure 2 and 3). The FEM is not an individual farm model, but rather tends to estimate NH3 emission factors that take into account general (regional) manure management practices and local meteorology.
