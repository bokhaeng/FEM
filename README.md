# FEM (Farm Emissions Model)
The FEM is a semi-empirical process-based emissions model, as they are based on a nitrogen mass balance with inputs of meteorological parameters and management practices to obtain the desired output of ammonia emissions as a function of time but will also be constrained through the use of tuned parameters to ensure agreement with previously reported ammonia emission factors.
